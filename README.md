Recreate the air pollution one
Describe the gene pipeline -->

[Predicting Air Pollution Hotspots Using Machine Learning](link) :
This project is a reimagined version of a previous academic project where me and my partner originally developed 4 ML models in R to [predict air pollution levels across the U.S](https://github.com/TartFroYo/Predicting-Ambient-Air-Pollution-PM2.5-Across-the-Contiguous-U.S/blob/main/README.md). 
The initial project focused on finding the most accurate prediction model out of four of our choosing based on RMSE and interpret it. In this updated version, I have rebuilt the project in Python, leveraging new datasets and machine learning techniques to improve predictive accuracy and real-world applicability. 
The goal is to create a model that can predict high-risk pollution zones, helping policymakers and urban planners make informed decisions about air quality management.

[Data Pipeline for Processing Raw Gene Data](https://github.com/TartFroYo/Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Pipeline%20for%20Processing%20Raw%20Gene%20Data) :
As part of a research initiative, I designed and implemented a data pipeline to process raw gene sequence data, transforming it into a structured format attached with the necessary info suitable for analysis. This involved data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and storage to facilitate downstream gene expression analysis. 
The pipeline was built using [R], and it automated the extraction and standardization of large genomic datasets. Despite not having access to the code, I can discuss the design choices, challenges, and impact of the project.
This experience strengthened my skills in ETL processes, data engineering principles, and optimizing workflows for large-scale biological data.

[Predicting Alzheimer's Disease in Patients](https://github.com/kristenlowe/predicting-alzheimers-diagnosis) :
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict Alzheimer's disease using the Alzheimer's Disease Dataset from Kaggle. 
The analysis begins with exploratory data analysis, including feature engineering, one-hot encoding, and visualizing trends in the data. 
Several models are implemented, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), logistic regression, lasso and ridge regression, stepwise selection, and tree-based models such as classification trees, random forests, bagging, and boosting. 
Model performance was assessed not only based on overall accuracy but also by evaluating sensitivity and specificity to ensure a balanced assessment of false positives and false negatives. 
Random forest emerged as the most effective model, achieving approximately 95% prediction accuracy. 
This project demonstrates the impact of machine learning in healthcare analytics and the importance of carefully selecting and evaluating models for medical diagnosis.

[Predicting Hazardous Near-Earth Objects ](https://github.com/TartFroYo/Predicting-Hazardous-Near-Earth-Objects/tree/main):
need to add description in this repo

This project analyzes data on near-Earth objects (NEOs) to predict which may pose a potential threat. Using Python, we performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and features, then applied machine learning models to classify NEOs based on their hazard potential. Visualizations and statistical insights helped refine predictions and improve model accuracy.

# Data Pipeline for Processing Raw Gene Data

## Project Overview
During my research, I contributed to building a data pipeline designed to process raw gene sequence data efficiently. The project aimed to streamline the extraction, transformation, and analysis of genomic data, ensuring high-quality inputs for downstream bioinformatics research.
This pipeline was essential because genomic datasets are often large, complex, and require extensive preprocessing before meaningful analysis can take place. By automating these steps, the pipeline significantly reduced manual data handling, minimized errors, and improved processing speed.

## Technologies & Tools Used
Programming Language: R, RStudio
Database Management: SQL
Data Storage: Cloud storage solutions (AWS, Google Drive, or institutional servers)
ETL Process: Custom scripts for Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: String manipulation, handling missing values, normalization

## Pipeline Workflow
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Ingestion
Raw gene sequencing data was obtained from external sources such as genomic databases, lab experiments, and institutional repositories.
Data arrived in formats such as FASTQ, CSV, and TSV, often requiring format conversion.
Data validation checks were performed to ensure completeness and accuracy before processing.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Transformation
Handled missing values by applying imputation methods or removing corrupt entries.
Standardized gene IDs and metadata to align with external reference datasets.
Applied filtering techniques to remove low-quality reads and noise.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Processing & Feature Engineering
Extracted meaningful genomic features such as mutation patterns, sequence lengths, and quality scores.
Applied statistical transformations to normalize data distributions.
Created aggregated summary tables for further analysis.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Storage & Retrieval
Processed datasets were stored in a SQL database for structured querying.
Implemented indexing techniques to improve data retrieval speed.
Cloud storage was used for scalability and backup purposes.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Final Output & Analysis
The pipeline generated cleaned, structured datasets that were used for:
Machine learning models predicting disease associations.
Statistical analysis of gene expression patterns.
Visualization dashboards for researchers to explore trends.
